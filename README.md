 
🗑️ Garbage Classification using PyTorch

This repository contains deep learning models for classifying garbage into different categories using image recognition with PyTorch

🌍 Importance of Garbage Classification

Garbage classification helps in efficient recycling, energy savings, economic sustainability, and protection of public health and the environment.
 Key Benefits:
- ♻️ Environmental Protection: Reduces pollution and conserves resources  
- ⚡ Energy Saving: Recycling consumes less energy than new production  
- 💰 Economic Value: Recyclables can be reused or sold  
- 🧼 Health & Safety: Prevents disease and promotes cleaner communities
🧠 Project Overview

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify garbage images into predefined categories. It includes two versions:

| Model Type      | Classes | Dataset Size | Accuracy | Branch / Folder       |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|----------|------------------------|
| Baseline Model  | 6       | 3,500 images | 93.5%    | `main`                 |
| Advanced Model  | 12      | 15,515 images| 97.6%    | `testbr/extra`         |
